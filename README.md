#Hungry Savers

**Hungry Savers** is a web project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, using **local storage** as the backend.  
Its main aim is to **reduce food wastage** by connecting **donors** who have surplus food with **receivers** such as orphanages and organizations that need food.

- **Donation Form** – Donors can list leftover food items with address details.
- **Request Form** – Receivers can view listed food and connect with donors.
- **Local Storage Backend** – Stores registrations, logins, and food listings in the browser.
